# Personal Project

Congratulations on making it through the first 11 weeks of Lambda Academy!  For your next week you will be working on a personal project.  There will be no formal classes held so you will be on your own to work on this project.  Be prepared to present what you've built to your class the day you return.  This project can give you an opportunity to practice and synthesize many of the topics that you've studied over the past three months.  This project will serve as a portfolio piece.

## Project Requirements

* Must be a full-stack project.  
  * Must have a back-end application and a client application.
* The client must either be a web or mobile application (You should use React).
* You must use a database (Preferably Mongo).
* Work on making it functional before making it look pretty.
* Other than these points your project can be anything you want it to be.
* Host your application. (You want future employers to be able to see your work on a live interactive demo. If you need help with hosting please reach out to your fellow peers/TA's/Instructors for assistence. There are a few really easy ways to accomplish this)

## Bonus

* Implement an authentication system.
* Add automated tests.
* Add documentation.
